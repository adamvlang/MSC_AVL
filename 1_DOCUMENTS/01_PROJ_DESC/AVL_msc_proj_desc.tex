\textbf{Aim:} The main objective of the thesis is to do a thorough literature study on different SLAM algorithms. The algorithms which are suitable for implementation on autonomous cars/trucks shall be studied. These algorithms should be modeled in Matlab/Simulink or C/C++, tested in a simulation environment and implemented in a real 1:10 scaled RC-car. The suggested tool for simulation is V-Rep~\footnote{http://www.coppeliarobotics.com} which is a software for robot simulation. A hardware platform with sensors on the RC-car is used to verify the results and should be developed and implemented during the thesis. Selection of the hardware platform and the sensors needs to be done during the thesis by the students. Computation load and memory requirements of the algorithms together with the price of the hardware and sensors shall be considered. The algorithms need to be run online on the hardware platform which should be installed on the vehicle. The algorithm should be able to work without accessing GPS. The algorithms which are not satisfying the mentioned criteria need to be discussed in the literature review, but they do not need to be implemented on the car. A comprehensive comparison in the form of a table of reference (or similar) of the different algorithms, is expected at the end of the project.
